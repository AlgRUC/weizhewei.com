**The ALGO Lab** is pleased to announce the release of the graph machine learning library **[Jittor Geometric](projects/jittor/)**, which provides detailed optimizations in graph storage, graph computation, and graph learning. It integrates and accelerates various existing graph neural network models, improving model runtime by 10% to 50% across multiple graph learning tasks compared to similar frameworks like Pytorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL). Everyone is welcome to try it out!
